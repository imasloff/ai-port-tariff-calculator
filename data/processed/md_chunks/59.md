In instances where cargo dues orders have not been received, such charges will be billed
to the container operator for container traffic and the vessel agent for bulk and breakbulk
traffic.

ISO containers filled with MT returns of whatever nature being returned for filling, provided a certificate is given to the effect that they are being returned to the original sender for
refilling, as well as new MT ISO containers will be regarded as an empty container. Transhipments are excluded from this ruling.

Cargo Dues Orders can be grouped and submitted as a list, i.e. one order supported by a
list containing the relevant container numbers, to the relevant Port Revenue Offices, as
follows (Imports and Exports separately):

- **Containers: On a per vessel, per container operator basis, separated between**

**deepsea, coastwise and transshipment movements.**

- **Breakbulk and Bulk: On a per vessel, per agent basis, separated between deepsea,**

**coastwise and transshipment movements.**

. [A single Cargo Dues Order can also be submitted for multiple containers provided that the ]

container numbers are indicated on the order and import and export orders are submitted separately. Orders should further be separated between deepsea, coastwise and
transhipments.

Any cancellations and amendments on this order will be applicable per cargo dues order.
Any applicable fees will be levied per cargo dues order.
